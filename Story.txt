1: have to pull/drag a board that is blocking the other player from moving on and they need to do the same for you.
2: boxes/walls look different and when moved reveal a small path way.
3: levers needing to be pulled at the same time.
4: pressure plates needing to be stood on to let the other progress.
5: final puzzle is they need to touch runes in order on the others map.
